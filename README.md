- Registrate new itens;

- Edit itens;
- Search for an item in your storage;

## Execution

To execute this code, follow the steps:

- Download and extract it;
- Download the dependencies(express is the only dependence);
- Open the terminal and go to the "backend" repository;
-- Run the line "node index.js";

At first, the code will run on the port 4000, if you want to change it, go to the index.js file and change the value of the const "PORT" to the port that you want to use.

-Now open browser and go to "http://localhost:4000";

ps: If you've changed the port, you need to put the new port instead of "4000";
